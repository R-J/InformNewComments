InformNewComments
=================

It's annoying that you never see if there are new comments in the discussion that you are looking at and that you even maybe are just about to respond to.   
This plugin shows you an info message whenever there are new comments in the current discussion. The interval of the checking for new comments can be configured in the settings screen.
